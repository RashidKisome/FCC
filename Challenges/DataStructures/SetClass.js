/*  

In this exercise we are going to create a class named Set to emulate an abstract data structure called "set". A set is like an array, but it cannot contain duplicate values. The typical use for a set is to simply check for the presence of an item. We can see how the ES6 Set object works in the example below:

const set1 = new Set([1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 2, 0]);
console.log(set1);
// output: {1, 2, 3, 5, 0}
console.log(set1.has(1));
// output: true
console.log(set1.has(6));
// output: false


First, we will create an add method that adds a value to our set collection as long as the value does not already exist in the set. 
Then we will create a remove method that removes a value from the set collection if it already exists. 
And finally, we will create a size method that returns the number of elements inside the set collection.
Create an add method that adds a unique value to the set collection and returns true if the value was successfully added and false otherwise.
Create a remove method that accepts a value and checks if it exists in the set. 
If it does, then this method should remove it from the set collection, and return true. 
Otherwise, it should return false. 
Create a size method that returns the size of the set collection.

class Set {
  constructor() {
    // Dictionary, items for our set
    this.dictionary = {};
    this.length = 0;
  } // This method will check for the presence of an element and return true or false
  has(element) {
    return this.dictionary[element] !== undefined;
  }
  // This method will return all the values in the set
  values() {
    return Object.values(this.dictionary);
  }
  add(element) {
    if (!this.has(element)) {
      this.dictionary[element] = element;
      this.length++;
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }

  // This method will remove element from the set
  remove(element) {
    if (this.has(element)) {
      delete this.dictionary[element];
      this.length--;
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }

  // This will return the length of the set
  size() {
    return this.length;
  }
  // Only change code above this line
}

Problem Explanation
A Set is an abstract data structure.
It can store unique value and the collection is unordered.
In this challenge, we have to implement:
.add() method
This method should only add unique values to dictionary. The method should return true, if the value is successfully added to the dictionary and update the length property, otherwise it should return false.
.remove() method
This method should only remove values from dictionary. The method should return true, if the value is successfully removed from the dictionary and update the length property, otherwise it should return false if the element doesnâ€™t exist.
.size() method
This method should return the length property;
